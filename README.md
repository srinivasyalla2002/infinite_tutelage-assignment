# Infinite Tutelage Assignment
# Responsive React Dashboard
This is a responsive React Dashboard project that includes a sidebar, quick links, an overview chart, trading accounts, open trades, and more. The dashboard is designed to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

# Features
- Responsive Design: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Sidebar: Contains navigation links with icons for Dashboard, CRM, MAM, PAMM, Trade, Wallet, Accounts, History, Notifications, Settings, Help & Support, and Logout. It also displays the user profile information.
- Quick Links: Provides shortcuts to essential actions like Deposit, Withdraw, Settings, Verification, and others.
- Overview Section: Displays a chart with filters for Monthly and Yearly views.
- Trading Accounts: Shows master account balances.
- Open Trades: Lists the current open trades with profit/loss details.
# Usage
Once the development server is running, you can view the dashboard in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The dashboard is fully responsive, so you can resize the browser window or view it on different devices to see how the layout adjusts.

# Components
- Sidebar
Displays the navigation menu with icons and a user profile section.

- Quick Links
Provides quick access to various actions like Deposit, Withdraw, Settings, etc.

- Overview

- Trading Accounts

- Open Trades

# CSS Structure
The project uses a responsive CSS design with media queries to adapt to different screen sizes:

- Mobile (up to 600px): Stacks components vertically.
- Tablet (601px to 1024px): Similar to mobile but with more padding.
- Desktop (1025px and up): Displays components side-by-side where appropriate.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
